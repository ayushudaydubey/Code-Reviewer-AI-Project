Okay, I see you've provided a simple JavaScript code snippet!

This code does the following:

1.  Declares a variable `a` and sets its value to `10`.
2.  Declares a variable `b` and sets its value to `20`.
3.  Calculates the sum of `a` and `b` (`10 + 20`).
4.  Logs the result of the sum to the console.

When you run this code, the output in your console will be:

```
30
```

Let me know if you have any other code snippets you'd like to share or if you have any questions about this or anything else!
Okay, I see you've provided a simple JavaScript snippet.

```javascript
let a =  10
let b = 20
console.log(a+b)
```

When you run this code, it will calculate the sum of `a` (10) and `b` (20) and print it to the console.

The output will be:

```
30
```

Great start! Let me know if you have any other code snippets or MERN stack questions!
That code will output the sum of `a` and `b`.

Here's the output:

```
